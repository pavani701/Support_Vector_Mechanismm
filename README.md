# Project Title:Using the support vector mechanism algorithm of supervised manchine learning, predict iris.csv dataset to find out species be same or not.

# Probelm Statement:A American based botinical gardens a grow iris flower in their labs but using biotechnology in a single tree different types of varity flower is grow.As a datascience engineering find out how much accuarcy is their all categories contains same species.

# Task-1:Preprocess the data in skit.learn library.
# Task-2:Load the data using sk.learn model selection default argument
# Task-3:On basis of datasets train,test and split of your svn model.
# Task-4:Implement support vector mechanism classifier using svm_clasifier.The svm must be "Linear".
# Task-5:Train the classifier on training data.
# Task-6:Find out the prediction value on the test data.
# Task-7:Test the model with help of accuarcy,accuacry should be liein the range of 0-1.
# Import libraries
# Load the Iris dataset
# Consider only two classes for simplicity
# Consider only two classes for simplicity
# Create an SVM classifier
# Train the classifier on the training data

# Make predictions on the test data
# Calculate accuracy

# Conclusion:Accoding to my support vector mechanism model the spices are linaer.with the accuarcy of 1.00.
Hence proved model was successfully implemeted
